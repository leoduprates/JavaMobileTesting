# java-appium-cucumber-sample

This project is an example of mobile testing automation. The project use Appium framework  with Java technology applying the Gherkin syntax.

Difference from the principle of BDD (Agile development technique) here Gherkin is used to make test scripts more expressive. In this way, how things describe all the actions of the user perform to interact (buttons, texts, gestures and etc.) going beyond the business context.

The proposal of automation of tests allows an index of reutilization of code high and of low complexity, simplicity and performance in the construction of automated tests.
